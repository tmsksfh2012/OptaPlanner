 * Usually created with {@link ConstraintCollectors}.

 * @param <B> the type of the second fact of the tuple in the source {@link QuadConstraintStream}
 * @param <C> the type of the third fact of the tuple in the source {@link QuadConstraintStream}
 * @param <D> the type of the fourth fact of the tuple in the source {@link QuadConstraintStream}
 * @param <ResultContainer_> the mutable accumulation type (often hidden as an implementation detail)
 * @param <Result_> the type of the fact of the tuple in the destination {@link ConstraintStream}
 *        It is recommended that this type be deeply immutable.
 *        Not following this recommendation may lead to hard-to-debug hashing issues down the stream,
 *        especially if this value is ever used as a group key.
